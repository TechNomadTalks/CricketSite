3. ✅ **Step 3:** Review booking → Calculates total price correctly
4. ⚠️ **Submit:** Shows demo alert (needs backend to actually save & process payment)

## ⚠️ What Needs Backend

To make bookings actually work, you need to implement the backend:

### Option 1: Firebase + Google Sheets (Recommended)
**What it does:**
- Stores bookings in Google Sheets
- Processes PayFast payments
- Sends email confirmations
- Checks real availability

**Cost:** R0/month (free tier)

**Setup Time:** ~2 hours

**You need:**
1. Firebase account
2. Google Sheets API credentials
3. PayFast merchant account

### Option 2: Supabase (Alternative)
**What it does:**
- PostgreSQL database for bookings
- User authentication
- Real-time updates
- PayFast integration

**Cost:** R0/month (free tier)

**Setup Time:** ~1 hour

**You need:**
1. Supabase account
2. PayFast merchant account

## 🎯 Next Steps

### To Make Bookings Work:

1. **Choose Backend Option** (Firebase or Supabase)
2. **I'll help you:**
   - Create Firebase Cloud Functions OR Supabase Edge Functions
   - Integrate Google Sheets API
   - Set up PayFast payment processing
   - Connect email notifications
   - Test complete booking flow

3. **You provide:**
   - Firebase/Supabase credentials
   - Google Sheets API key (for Firebase option)
   - PayFast merchant credentials

### Or Keep Demo Mode:
If you want to show the website without backend first, everything works perfectly in demo mode. The UI is fully functional, responsive, and looks professional.
